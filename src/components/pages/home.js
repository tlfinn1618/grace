            We are your neighbors who want only to make sure that you do not
            miss the grace of God. (Hebrews 12:25) Join us to hear it,
            experience it, and learn to give it to others. On your first visit
            youâ€™ll find a Jesus centered, grace oriented Adventism striving to
            love each other within a racially, generationally, & culturally
            diverse community of believers. Pastor Greg Webster
